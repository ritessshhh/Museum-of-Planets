# Museum-of-Planets
## Introduction
Welcome to my website! This website was created using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. It serves as a showcase for my skills and projects. Below, you will find an overview of the different sections of my website and their respective features.
The complete website was made using bootstrap and very less javascript. It is just to showcase that we can make websites without the help of javascript.
